C++ Snake Game – One-Page Project Summary 
Project Title: 
Console-Based Snake Game in C++ 
Overview: 
This project is a classic Snake game implemented in C++ using a text-based console 
interface. The snake moves within a grid, eats randomly placed fruits, and grows in length 
while avoiding collisions with its own tail. 
Technologies Used: - Language: C++ - Libraries: - <iostream> for input/output - <conio.h> for real-time keyboard input - <windows.h> for console functions like clearing screen and delay (Sleep) 
Game Features: - Snake head and tail rendering in a 20x20 grid - Fruit randomly appears on the board - Snake grows by one unit when a fruit is eaten - Score increases by 10 with each fruit - Snake wraps around walls (no border death) - Game ends when the snake hits its own tail - Real-time movement using WASD keys - Press X to exit anytime 
Controls: - W – Up - S – Down - A – Left - D – Right - X – Exit 
Limitations & Scope for Improvement: - No graphical interface; purely text-based - No levels or speed progression - No sound or high score tracking - Could improve by adding difficulty modes, better UI, and high-score system
